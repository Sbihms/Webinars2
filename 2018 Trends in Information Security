What will be shaping InfoSec in 2018:

data - and analytics - at scale. Sheer volume of data and applying analytics
At the center: "New IT" - could computing revolutionizing IT
At the edge: All kinds of new "smart" endpoints

Forces in opposition that create tension:

Cloud vs legacy/hybrid
cloud vs IOT

Top 5 most common security projects:
Security awareness initiative (teaching people about spam, etc)
Security info and event management (SIEM)
Endpoint Security solutions
Cloud Infrastructure Security
Vulnerability Assessment

Every security product will become an analytics product because of big data. New segments that deliver analytics will arise: user behavior analytics (UBA) and network. Machine learning - particularly in recognizing malicious and malware activity.

2. Security automation: playing out on three fronts:
in multiple segments that already enable or enhance automation for security. This came about because of a shortage of security folks and difficulty hiring.
increasing penetration of tools specifically to support security process automation.
continued advance of "new" IT


Automation and security: 3 domains
tools and techniques already in exiting segments
systems management
complex firewall management
risk based authentication
With IT ops: tickething and runbook automation
New players arising to serve secp[x and process management across security and IT
Security process automation - indiv tasks
Orchestration: complex autom., multiple tasks
automation native to cloud and devops environment

The goal of automizing analytics:
actionable situation awareness
gathering: external intelligence
policy-context
monitoring - investigation
Synthesis:
better, more immedediate recognition of concerns across more data
making the most of what machines and people each do best
Response
translating insight directly into action
automation when it makes a difference

Network security vendors will face the identity-aware perimeter
Security spending on vendor-based tools:
network security (firewalls, intrusion management, network based anti-malware)
Endpoint security (anti virus, data leakage prevention)
Security management (SIEM, vulnerability assessment)
Application Security (DAST/SAST/WAF)
